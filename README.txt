How does the calculation are performed for the standard style
Each turn character can make a critical strike or strike normaly(1), have an extra acttack(2), evade an attack(3), make a perfect strike(4). So 4 actions can be performed each turn.
If an extra attack is successfully done, the first step is repeating one time again but without the possiblity to make an extra-attack.
To exploit enemy elemental weakness, heroes need to have an equiped sword that matched the enemy elemental weakness (ex: fire weakness with fire elemental weapon). The elemental buff that is going to be
applyed is the elemental bearing the same name as the weapon (ex:fire for character with fire elemental weapon).
Elemental damage can be rised by investiong buff as reward after each battle.
CritDamage can be rised by investing buff in criticalstrike damage and equiping a weapon.
Critical strike chance can only be increased by equiping a weapon.
